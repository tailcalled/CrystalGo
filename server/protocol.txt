Crystal Go Protocol
===================

When connecting to a server, the client writes either 'spectate', 'black' or
'white', depending on which role it wishes to have. In response, if the role is
not available, the server writes 'no' followed by a newline, and waits for a
new choice of role; otherwise it sends 'ok' followed by a newline and a
snapshot of the current board.

Board Snapshot
--------------

To send a snapshot of the board, the program sends the number of columns c and
rows r on the board, separated by a whitespace.

On the following r lines, the board is sent as a sequence of x's (for black
stones), o's (for white stones) and spaces (for empty spaces).

After the board, there will be a line with two numbers describing the number of
stones black and white have captured.

Turns
-----

At each players turn, the player sends the column and row of where they place
their next stone, with the first column being column 0 and the first row being
row 0. If the player sends an invalid line, the server responds with a line
containing exactly 'no'. Otherwise, all connected clients receive a new board
snapshot with the updated state.

A player may also write 'pass' in order to pass their turn. In this case, all
connected clients will also receive a new board snapshot, even though the
board hasn't changed.

Win
---

If a player wins, the server writes the color (either 'black' or 'white') to
all clients, followed by the string ' wins', and then closes all connections.

Msg
---

Both the server and the client may at any point send a line starting with the
text 'msg '.
