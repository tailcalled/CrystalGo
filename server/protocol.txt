Crystal Go Protocol
===================

When connecting to a server, the client writes either 'spectate', 'black' or
'white', depending on which role it wishes to have. In response, if the role is
not available, the server writes 'taken' and closes the connection; otherwise
it writes 'ok' followed by a newline and sends a snapshot of the current board.

Board Snapshot
--------------

To send a snapshot of the board, the program sends the number of columns c and
rows r on the board, separated by a whitespace.

On the following r lines, the board is sent as a sequence of x's (for black
stones), o's (for white stones) and spaces (for empty spaces.

Turns
-----

At each players turn, the player sends the column and row of where they place
their next stone, with the first column being column 0 and the first row being
row 0. If the player sends an invalid line, the server responds with a line
containing exactly 'no'. Otherwise, all connected clients receive a new board
snapshot with the updated state.

Win
---

If a player wins, the server writes the color (either 'black' or 'white') to
all clients, followed by the string ' wins', and then closes all connections.
